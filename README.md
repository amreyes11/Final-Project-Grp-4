# California County Poverty Levels Affecting Hospital Performance Ratings

![ratings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119356418/236340784-ccbd842a-755d-4cdf-a6fa-aa115ec569b7.jpeg)


# Project Overview
We will be analyzing California counties’ poverty levels with California counties, hospitals, and performance level based on hospital procedures performed between 2016-2020 to determine and evaluate if poverty levels correlate with hospital performance and how impactful it is.

# Questions to answer
* How will California County hospitals perform when comparing hospital ratings and the total number of adverse events?
* How does a county’s percentage of poverty correlate to hospital procedure performance rating?

# Expectations
* We expect counties with higher cases of poverty to have lower performance ratings of hospital procedures performed compared to hospitals in counties with less cases of poverty.
* We expect to see a higher number of adverse cases and a higher risk adjusted rate in more poverty-ridden counties with worse hospital ratings than in less poverty-ridden counties.

# Data Description
* California poverty by county
* California hospital rating by county

	1.  Abhipsha Chatterjee
	2.  Denisse Farias
	3.  Natasha Nutley
	4.  April Reyes

# Objectives
	1. Analyze the data
	2. Showcase visualizations of trends
	3. Create predictive model to forecast future performance 
	
# Methodology
* Data Exploration
* Data Cleaning
* Data Analysis
* Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Reporting

# Resources
* Tableau
* Jupyter notebook/ Python
* Mlenv for machine learning 
* Time series evaluations

#  Data Exploration and Data Cleaning
We assessed the dataset for both hospital ratings and poverty levels and determined several items were not required in accordance to the expectations.  

	*  Determined connection between datasets
	
	*  Chose optimal areas for analysis from both datasets 
	
	*  Cleaned datasets according to focus points

#  Results
As demonstrated in the visualizations, we can conclude that:

	* counties with higher cases of poverty show lower performance ratings of hospital procedures performed compared to hospitals in counties with less cases of poverty.
	
	* higher number of adverse cases and a higher risk adjusted rate are seen in more poverty-ridden counties with worse hospital ratings than in less poverty-ridden counties.

# Project Review
Other factors that could potentially affect the data exploration phase and paint a different, perhaps more insightful picture:   

	1.	Social Determinants of the Health Theory Model
	2.	Examining the levels of the following for practitioners:
			*  Training 
			*  Education
	3.  	Access a deep dive in mortality and birth rate
	4.  	Biased data observed

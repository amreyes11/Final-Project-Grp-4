![ratings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119356418/236340784-ccbd842a-755d-4cdf-a6fa-aa115ec569b7.jpeg)


# Project Overview
We will be analyzing California counties’ poverty levels with California counties, hospitals, and performance level based on hospital procedures performed between 2016-2020 to determine and evaluate if poverty levels correlate with hospital performance and how impactful it is.

# Questions to answer
* How will California County hospitals perform when comparing hospital ratings and the total number of adverse events?
* How does a county’s percentage of poverty correlate to hospital procedure performance rating?

# Expectations
* We expect counties with higher cases of poverty to have lower performance ratings of hospital procedures performed compared to hospitals in counties with less cases of poverty.
* We expect to see a higher number of adverse cases and a higher risk adjusted rate in more poverty-ridden counties with worse hospital ratings than in less poverty-ridden counties.

# Project Overview

In this segment, the presentation deliverable includes the following:

	* The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection 

	* A description of the data 
	
	* The questions that the team plans to answer with the project 

We will be analyzing California counties’ poverty levels with California counties, hospitals, and performance level based on hospital procedures performed between 2016-2020 to determine and evaluate if poverty levels correlate with hospital performance and how impactful it is.

# Expectations
	* We expect counties with higher cases of poverty to have lower performance ratings of hospital procedures performed compared to hospitals in counties with less cases of poverty.
	* We expect to see a higher number of adverse cases and a higher risk adjusted rate in more poverty-ridden counties with worse hospital ratings than in less poverty-ridden counties.


# Data Description
	* California poverty by county
	* California hospital rating by county
